<div data-post-content="true" class="post_content" id="post_content"><p>He’s no monk on a mountaintop, nor does he shun
    the secular world, but for the past three years, Marcus Gallagher has abstained from pornography—and he’s not
    looking back.</p>
    <p>Like many guys, Gallagher (who chose a pseudonym for anonymity) first encountered pornography in seventh grade.
        What started as curiosity evolved into a gratifying escape, then an irresistible urge, and, ultimately, an
        impediment to his life.</p>
    <p>As his habit grew, Gallagher found himself increasingly uneasy around others, especially girls, and struggling
        with an endless buzzing in his mind. “Every minute, I was thinking of something sexual, like pornography,” he
        recalled.</p>
    <div class="h-[0px] border-t border-gray-200 mt-3 mb-6"></div>
    <p>That’s when he started considering practicing abstinence.</p>
    <div class="my-5">Gallagher is not alone. A growing number of young people are joining the trend of ejaculatory
        abstinence, or “semen retention,” as it is often called, which means refraining from emission for a specified
        period. “Semen retention” and related hashtags are among the <a
                href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41443-022-00645-6" target="_blank" class="article-hover-class">most
            popular</a> men’s health topics on social media, garnering well over 2 billion impressions on TikTok and 3
        million on Instagram.
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">Participants may choose this practice for various reasons. Some treat it as a half-joke,
        half-serious challenge among friends; some believe it can boost testosterone and muscle—which the present
        science hasn’t proved. But to men like Gallagher, it’s a challenge of breaking away from a decade-long
        addiction, which came with unexpected mental benefits.<h2>The Growing Appetite for Unreality</h2><a
                href="https://www.addictionhelp.com/porn/statistics/" target="_blank" class="article-hover-class">Studies</a>
        indicate that approximately 69 percent of American men and 40 percent of American women consume online
        pornography annually, with 11 percent of men and 3 percent of women reporting addiction.

    <p>“The brain becomes more sensitive to and stimulated by the pixels, as opposed to people,” explained John D.
        Foubert, dean of the College of Education at Union University in Tennessee, a renowned expert in sexual assault
        prevention and author of over 30 peer-reviewed articles and books on related topics.</p>
    <p>“Pornography literally rewires the brain,” Clare Morell, a policy analyst specializing in technology and mental
        health, told The Epoch Times. “It creates habitual neural pathways so that the person needs to continue to
        access pornography due to such a high level of dopamine being released in the brain when they view this type of
        content.”</p>
    <p>Porn is a “supranormal stimulus” that depicts an unrealistic and exaggerated version of sexuality, with highly
        curated, surgically enhanced bodies acting out extreme sexual scenarios, said Dr. Donald L. Hilton Jr,
        neurosurgeon and internationally recognized expert on the neuroscience of pornography. This visual
        hyperstimulation can hijack the normal reproductive drive, desensitizing the brain to authentic human intimacy
        and relationships.</p>
    <p>Almost everything else seems bleak and unworthy of pursuing, Hilton described.</p>

    <p>However, not all experts agree that pornography consumption is detrimental or addictive. Nicole Prause, a
        neuroscientist researching human sexual behavior, addiction, and porn, told The Epoch Times that the Diagnostic
        and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have rejected the
        idea of “pornography addiction” as a clinical diagnosis.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Prause suggested that in many cases, people who think they have a porn or masturbation problem may be struggling
        with more common issues like depression. She advocates addressing the underlying mental health concerns rather
        than framing it as an addiction issue.</p>
    <p>Hilton challenged the notion that porn doesn’t meet addiction criteria.</p>
    <div class="my-5">“Consider hypothetically two individuals, frantically fixated to their computers, both trying to
        win an intermittently reinforced reward,” he wrote in a <a
                href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3960020/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"
                class="article-hover-class">paper</a> published on Socioaffective Neuroscience &amp; Psychology. “One is
        looking at pornography, searching for just the right clip for sexual consummation; the other is engrossed in an
        online poker game.”
    </div>
    <p>Both exhibit identical behavioral patterns—spending hours pursuing their fix, damaging relationships, and being
        unable to stop. Yet as Hilton pointed out, “The DSM-5 classifies only the poker as an addiction.” He argues this
        distinction is “both behaviorally and biologically inconsistent,” given the similar patterns of compulsive
        behavior and negative life impact.</p>

        “compulsive sexual behaviour disorder” (CSBD) in 2019, characterizing it as “a persistent pattern of failure to
        control intense, repetitive sexual impulses or urges resulting in repetitive sexual behaviour.”
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">Dr. Rena Malik, a urologist, pelvic surgeon, and medical influencer, told The Epoch Times that
        sexual behavior becomes problematic only when it interferes with other daily activities. She explained this
        includes “going to work on time, being productive at work, interacting with your family, friends, loved ones, or
        being intimate with a partner.”<h2>Those Who Delay Gratification Win</h2>“There is no such thing as an addiction
        in moderation,” said Gallagher.
    </div>
    <p>Once you develop a porn addiction, it’s hard to stop, he shared. By acting without restraint, people risk
        becoming “eternally possessed” by these desires, losing self-control. Gallagher argues that self-control is a
        unique human capacity that should be guarded and cultivated.</p>
    <div class="my-5">Indeed, excessive pornography erodes people’s self-control, according to research. A 2016 <a
            href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26305628/" target="_blank" class="article-hover-class">study</a>
        published in The Journal of Sex Research found that increased porn consumption leads to a decreased ability to
        delay immediate rewards for greater future benefits.

    <p>In a subsequent study, the researchers had one group of porn users refrain from pornography while another group
        abstained from their favorite food for three weeks.</p>
    <p>The researchers found that those who quit pornography developed stronger self-control, becoming better at
        postponing immediate desires to attain more significant future rewards. By contrast, those who gave up their
        favorite food did not show this improvement. The researchers concluded that “regular self-control in some
        domains (e.g., sexual) might be more powerful than self-control exercised in other domains (e.g., food).”</p>

    <p>By consciously engaging in abstinence and limiting porn use, individuals may enhance their self-discipline,
        leading to improved outcomes in various aspects of life, Gallagher suggested. “Because I can tackle such a hard
        problem, doing other hard things doesn’t seem so hard anymore,” he explained.</p>

    <div class="my-5">The children who delayed gratification for the second marshmallow were followed for over 40 years.

    <p>Traditional medicine, particularly traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), offers a more explicit stance, warning
        against casual and indiscriminate discharge.</p>
    <p>“Current research promotes frequent ejaculation for prostate health and stress relief. TCM, however, emphasizes
        balance,” says Dr. Jingduan Yang, a fifth-generation TCM teacher and practitioner, board-certified psychiatrist,
        and CEO of Northern Medical Center in Middletown, New York.</p>

    <p>In TCM, sexual health is seen as a balance of essence (jing) and qi, two types of energy in our bodies. Essence
        is the core energy for growth, reproduction, and vitality, while qi is the daily energy that drives our
        functions.</p>
    <p>Essence is harder to replenish, so preserving it, especially in winter, enhances physical resilience and mental
        clarity, Yang explained to The Epoch Times.</p>
    <p>According to TCM, the kidneys are considered the storehouse of this “essence,” and every ejaculation depletes
        this essence. This is because ejaculation requires physical exertion, the discharge of nutrients, and vital
        fluids used to create sperm.</p>
    <p>“Ejaculation triggers complex nervous system activities: the parasympathetic (rest and digest) system promotes
        relaxation, while the sympathetic (flight or fight) nervous system takes over during ejaculation, leading to
        intense physical exertion and energy output. TCM views this exertion as drawing on kidney energy, which, if
        depleted too frequently, can lead to imbalances or lower energy reserves over time,” he added.</p>

        general weakness, musculoskeletal pain, dizziness, and sexual dysfunction.

    <p>“Modern medicine tries to rationalize it (ejaculation) as natural and without harm, but from an energetic level,
        there are serious short-term and long-term effects,” Jonathan Liu, a TCM practitioner, told The Epoch Times.
        “From my clinical practice, kidney essence deficiency is indeed related to some conditions like poor memory,
        fatigue, even some dementia cases.”</p>
    <p>Ryan B. (pseudonym) is among the many men who report decreased energy after ejaculation. “I always feel tired
        afterward—like I’m just out of energy,” he told The Epoch Times.</p>
    <p>“Sexual behavior is not just for pleasure; its proper role is for procreation,” Liu said. He suggests conserving
        the body’s vital energy to maintain health.</p>

    <p>“Restraint isn’t about deprivation but cultivation,” Yang said. He suggests this cultivation tempers
        self-discipline and can heighten spiritual awareness and productivity. “However, balance and individual health
        needs are key,” he added.</p>
    <div class="my-5">Historically, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01534067" target="_blank"
                                       class="article-hover-class">all</a> the major religions and philosophies have
        encouraged various forms of self-control and have even strictly prohibited masturbation. Judaism and Islam
        practice fasts and encourage moderation. Hinduism promotes awareness and control over the senses. In
        Christianity, some denominations advocate celibacy or abstaining from sex before marriage.

    <div class="my-5">These practices aim to redirect energy from immediate gratification toward spiritual, mental, and
        physical growth. In the early 1800s, European and American physicians even <a

        attitudes toward sexual restraint.

    <div class="my-5">“Abstaining is not going to physically hurt you. It’s more the attitude that often comes with it
        that is,” Prause said.<h2>The Way Out: Purpose Over Pleasure</h2>Every year, Gallagher would try to abstain from
        masturbation for an entire month. “Every single time I tried, I failed,” he said. Nonetheless, he persisted.

    <p>Gallagher, now a 26-year-old software engineer, eventually began reaping the benefits. “Now, I’m looking back,
        and I have so much more mental clarity,” he explained. What came along was increased confidence and
        empowerment.</p>
    <p>“We seem to be in the midst of a masculinity crisis … and this is changing how men feel like they fit in the
        world,” said Justin Lehmiller, a senior research fellow at the Kinsey Institute and host of the Sex &amp;
        Psychology Podcast. The trend of ejaculatory abstinence is “part of a much bigger movement that’s about
        restoring masculinity,” he told The Epoch Times.</p>
    <p>“A man who lacks purpose distracts himself with pleasure,” said Gallagher, further commenting that many people
        are engrossed in the modern hedonistic culture of instant gratification, drinking, smoking, and drug use.</p>
    <p>Yet he believes there is hope. “It is inevitable that once someone reaches the end of this path and realizes its
        hollowness, they will naturally start looking in the other direction, towards something more virtuous and
        fulfilling,“ he said. ”When the pendulum reaches one extreme, it will inevitably start to go the other way.”</p>

    <p>For those considering a similar path, Gallagher proposed practical steps for quitting. For immediate urge
        management, he mentioned that some of his friends found success with physical activities like doing push-ups
        when temptation strikes. He recommended journaling as a tool to reinforce reasons for stopping and to reflect on
        past decisions.</p>
    <p>He emphasized the importance of understanding the addictive nature of porn use and masturbation, encouraging
        reframing one’s perspective by questioning the fundamental purpose and impact of the behavior on one’s life and
        relationships.</p>
    <p>Above all, he believes that purpose through spirituality is the best way out.</p>
    <p>“Stopping an addiction like this is really hard, near impossible, without the help of God,” said Gallagher.</p>
    <p>For some people, abstinence can be a game changer, said Foubert.</p>
    <p>“See what it does to your loneliness, to your depression, to your anxiety, to your intimate relations with other
        people and see if that’s something you like and it may be something that you want to continue beyond,” he
        said.</p></div>
